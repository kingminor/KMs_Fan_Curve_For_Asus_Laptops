# KMs_Fan_Curve_For_Asus_Laptops
Hello World!

This is a fan curve based on Karmel0x's Asus Fan Control Software (Found Here: https://github.com/Karmel0x/AsusFanControl). I liked it, but wanted too use it with fan control. 

To run it, open a terminal and navigate to the head directory then run KMs_Fan_Curve_For_Asus_Laptops.exe. It will ask you to input the points for the curve. Once that is done, it will adjust the fan speed based on CPU temperature, changing every 10 seconds. 

I am still very new to the using C# for anything other than Unity Game Engine so there are likely many optimizations that can be made. I also have no clue how to save the fan curve for future use, I will keep working on it. Sudgestions are always welcome.

Have a great day!

Known Issues: inputing a temp of 0 C can break everything!
